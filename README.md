# Inventory Bogosorter

This is aims to replace the popular Inventory Tweaks mod.

### Why?

Inventory Tweaks API is very limited. It doesn't work well with modular gui libraries like ModularUI. It also has desync bugs, since it is client side only.

### Why rewrite and not just fork?

The Inventory Tweaks code is very unpleasant to work with. I rather write my own clean mod.
